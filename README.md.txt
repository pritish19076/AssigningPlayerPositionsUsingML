# Assigning Field Positions to Football Players using Machine Learning

Determining the best player position for a player is a key to the success of a team in soccer. The purpose of this research is to find out the best playing position of a player, by assessing the attributes of each player from the FIFA dataset. We propose the use of the FIFA Soccer video
game dataset, as there is a lack of a large scale dataset
with player attributes. To find out the best position of
each player, we have used various Machine Learning Models. 

This study is done as a part of Machine Learning Course(CSE-343/ECE-343) under Prof. Dr. Jainendra Shukla

## Dataset

We have used the [FIFA-21 Complete Player dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset) available on Kaggle for our study purposed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis


## Running the Project
The uploaded notebook 'Assigning_Field_Position_To_Football_Players.ipynb' contains all the relevant code of our study, and contains the following sections - 
1. Necessary Imports and Fetch Dataset
2. Preprocessing of dataset
3. EDA
4. Handling class imbalance
5. Feature Study
6. Higher dimensional Visualisation using PCA
7. Evaluation of all Models - Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Multiclass Logistic Regression, MLP Classifier, KNN, ADABoost, GradientBoost, and XGBoost Classifiers. 

To run it, just upload the notebook to Google Colab, and Run all the cells and do the necessary authentication.
